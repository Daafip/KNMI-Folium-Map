# KNMI-Folium-Map
Webscrapes the KNMI website and makes a folium map out of the locations. 

# using the maps:
The three HTML files can be used locally to see which KNMI station is closest.
Alternatively, the notebook can be viewed on nbviewer.org, which can be seen [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Daafip/KNMI-Folium-Map/blob/main/Hourly%20%26%20daily%20station%20data%20KNMI%202023-03-21.html)

# running the code 
The code is writen in a jupyter notebook and can be reproduced and used there. 

#### Packages
A requirements.yml is availible {TODO}, this can be used with [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to install the correct packages needed. A new conda environment is advised as the geospatial packages are fairly demanding. Namely [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org) & [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) are needed.
