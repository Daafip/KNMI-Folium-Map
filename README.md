#### Packages
A requirements.yml is availible, this can be used with [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to install the correct packages needed. A new conda environment is advised as the geospatial packages are fairly demanding. Namely [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org) & [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) are needed.
